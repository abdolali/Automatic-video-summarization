# Automatic-video-summarization
Key frames or representative frames are a set of salient images extracted from the video source. 
The implemented method is based on sliding window SVD presented in the following paper:
Badeau R, Richard G, David B. Sliding window adaptive SVD algorithms. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing. 2004 Jan;52(1):1-0.
